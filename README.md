# Love-CHIP8
A CHIP-8 emulator made with l√∂ve, with imgui as a front-end.

It depends on love-imgui, you must include it inside the project for it to work.

To open ROMs, drag-and-drop a file onto the window, or put the file path as an argument.

You can find ROMs [here](https://github.com/mir3z/chip8-emu/tree/master/roms).

### Note
If a game seems to glitch out or work unexpectedly, click "Enable alternative shift" under Emulation Settings.
